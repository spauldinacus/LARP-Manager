# Vercel Migration Progress

## âœ… Completed
1. **Created `/api` directory structure** following Vercel conventions
2. **Database Setup** - Created `api/lib/db.js` with neon-http driver for serverless
3. **Authentication Helpers** - Created `api/lib/auth.js` with password hashing and user lookup
4. **Core API Endpoints:**
   - `api/health.js` - Health check endpoint
   - `api/ping.js` - Simple ping endpoint  
   - `api/characters.js` - Characters CRUD with joins to heritage/culture/archetype
   - `api/chapters.js` - Chapters with member counts
   - `api/auth/login.js` - User authentication
   - `api/auth/register.js` - User registration
   - `api/admin/stats.js` - Admin dashboard statistics

5. **Vercel Configuration** - Created `vercel.json` with proper routing and environment variables

## ðŸ”„ Current Status
The foundation is complete! You now have:
- Serverless functions replacing Express routes
- Proper database connections using neon-http
- Authentication endpoints
- Core business logic endpoints

## ðŸš§ Next Steps for Full Migration

### 1. Complete API Coverage
Still need to create serverless functions for:
- Events management (`api/events.js`)
- RSVP system (`api/events/[id]/rsvps.js`)
- Experience tracking (`api/characters/[id]/experience.js`)
- Game data management (heritages, cultures, archetypes, skills)
- Admin user management
- Candle management

### 2. Session Management Strategy
Currently using basic approach. Options:
- **JWT tokens** stored in httpOnly cookies
- **Database sessions** with edge-compatible storage
- **Vercel Edge Config** for session data

### 3. Frontend Updates
- Update API calls to work with new serverless endpoints
- Handle authentication state without Express sessions
- Test all existing functionality

### 4. Deployment Configuration
- Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Configure domain and SSL
- Set up automatic deployments from Git

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Testing
The current setup can be tested by:
1. Deploying to Vercel
2. Setting DATABASE_URL environment variable
3. Testing endpoints like `/api/health`, `/api/characters`, `/api/chapters`

Would you like to continue with more endpoints or test the current setup?
