## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system for consistent, accessible components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens and dark theme support
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form handling

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for type safety

### Database Design
The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM and includes these main entities:
- **users**: User profiles with admin flags, authentication data, and chapter associations
- **chapters**: LARP chapters with player number generation capabilities
- **characters**: Player characters with heritage, culture, archetype, game statistics, and total XP spent tracking

- **systemSettings**: Application configuration storage

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Session-based Authentication**: Uses PostgreSQL for session storage with express-session

- **Session Storage**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session store

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across frontend and backend
- **Vite**: Fast development server and optimized builds
- **ESBuild**: Fast TypeScript compilation for production

- **Environment**: NODE_ENV-based configuration switching

### Architecture Decisions

**Why Drizzle ORM**: Chosen for type safety, SQL-like syntax, and excellent TypeScript integration over alternatives like Prisma or raw SQL.

**Why Session-based Auth**: Provides better security for server-rendered applications and simpler logout handling compared to JWT tokens.

**Why TanStack React Query**: Offers powerful caching, background updates, and optimistic updates compared to basic fetch or SWR.

**Why Radix UI**: Ensures accessibility compliance and provides unstyled, customizable primitives compared to fully-styled libraries.

**Why Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid UI development with consistent design tokens and excellent tree-shaking compared to CSS-in-JS solutions.
