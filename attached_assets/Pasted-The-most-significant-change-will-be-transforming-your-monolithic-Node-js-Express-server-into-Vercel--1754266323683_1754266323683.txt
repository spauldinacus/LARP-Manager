The most significant change will be transforming your monolithic Node.js Express server into Vercel's serverless function architecture. Vercel is optimized for this model.
Step 1: Create an /api directory.
In the root of your project, create a new folder named api. This is a Vercel convention. Any file within this directory will be treated as a serverless function, and its filename will become its endpoint.
Step 2: Refactor your Express routes into serverless functions.
Look at your existing Node.js Express server. You likely have routes defined like this:
JavaScript
// server.js
app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  // ...
});

app.post('/todos', async (req, res) => {
  // ...
});


You'll need to convert each of these into its own file inside the /api directory. For example:
For GET /users, create a file at api/users.js
For POST /todos, create a file at api/todos.js
Each of these files must export a single default function that handles the request and response.
JavaScript
// api/users.js
// Note: The `drizzle-orm/neon-http` driver is highly recommended for serverless.
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http';

// Your Drizzle ORM schema
import { users } from '../db/schema'; // Adjust the path as needed

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
const db = drizzle(sql);

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'GET') {
    try {
      const allUsers = await db.select().from(users).execute();
      return res.status(200).json(allUsers);
    } catch (error) {
      return res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
    }
  }
  // Handle other methods if needed
  return res.status(405).json({ message: 'Method not allowed' });
}


Important: You will no longer have a single server.js file that listens on a port (app.listen(...)). Vercel handles this for you.
Step 3: Update your frontend API calls.
Your React frontend, which likely called something like http://localhost:3000/api/users, will now simply call /api/users. Vercel automatically routes requests from your frontend to the corresponding serverless function.
