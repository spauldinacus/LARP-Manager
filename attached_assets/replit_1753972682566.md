# Thrune LARP Character Management System

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for managing characters, experience, and events in the Thrune LARP (Live Action Role Playing) game system. The application is built with React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL database, and is designed to run on Replit with integrated authentication.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system and dark theme
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless connection
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions using connect-pg-simple
- **Authentication**: Session-based with admin role system

### Database Design
The application uses PostgreSQL with the following main tables:
- **users**: User profiles with admin flags
- **characters**: Player characters with heritage, culture, archetype, and stats
- **experienceEntries**: Track XP awards with reasons and event associations
- **events**: LARP events that can award experience
- **systemSettings**: Application configuration storage

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Session-based authentication with PostgreSQL storage
- Admin role system for privileged operations
- Mock authentication system for demo purposes (can be replaced with Replit OAuth)
- Automatic login redirects for unauthorized access

### Character Management
- Character creation with official Thrune LARP ruleset validation
- Five heritage options (Ar-Nura, Human, Stoneborn, Ughol, Rystarri) with accurate Body/Stamina stats
- Complete culture system with 15 cultures across all heritages
- Full archetype system with 24 official archetypes
- Character sheet modal with accurate stat display

### User Interface
- Dark theme optimized design with purple primary colors
- Responsive layout with mobile support
- Admin dashboard with sidebar navigation
- Component-based architecture using shadcn/ui
- Form validation and error handling

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**: Users log in through mock system, session stored in PostgreSQL
2. **Character Creation**: Form validation → heritage/culture/archetype selection → database storage
3. **Experience Management**: XP entries linked to characters and events
4. **Admin Operations**: Protected routes for user and system management

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL connection for Neon database
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/react-***: UI component primitives
- **react-hook-form**: Form management
- **zod**: Schema validation

### Development Dependencies
- **Vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the stack
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **@replit/vite-plugin-***: Replit-specific development tools

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Vite dev server for frontend with hot module replacement
- Express server with TypeScript compilation via tsx
- File watching and auto-restart for backend changes
- Replit-specific plugins for enhanced development experience

### Production Build
- Vite builds optimized React bundle to `dist/public`
- esbuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
- Static file serving from built frontend
- Environment variable configuration for database connection

### Database Management
- Drizzle migrations stored in `./migrations` directory
- Schema definitions in `shared/schema.ts` for type sharing
- PostgreSQL dialect with Neon serverless connection
- Session storage using `connect-pg-simple`

The application follows a monorepo structure with shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend, ensuring type safety across the entire stack. The architecture is designed for easy development on Replit while maintaining production-ready patterns.
